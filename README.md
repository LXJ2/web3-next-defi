# Web3 Learning with Next.js Project

Welcome to the Web3 Learning with Next.js project repository! This project aims to provide a practical approach to learning Web3 technology while developing a project using Next.js, a popular React framework.

## Introduction

Web3 is a term often used to describe the next generation of the internet, which is decentralized, secure, and powered by blockchain technology. It encompasses various protocols, standards, and tools that enable peer-to-peer transactions, decentralized applications (dApps), and smart contracts.

Next.js, on the other hand, is a React framework that simplifies the process of building server-rendered React applications. It offers features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, making it an excellent choice for developing modern web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web3-learning-next.git

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the Development Server:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can access the project in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

pages/: Contains Next.js pages for routing and rendering components.
components/: Includes reusable React components used throughout the project.
public/: Contains static assets like images, fonts, etc.
styles/: Includes CSS stylesheets for styling the components.
